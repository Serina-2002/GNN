-  Evaluates using ARUC, Robustness (TPR), and Uniqueness (TNR)
-  Visualizes fingerprints with t-SNE and ROC/ARUC plots
-  Organized into modular Colab notebooks, matching paper sections
-  Matches or exceeds results from the original GNNFingers paper



Overview

 What is GNNFingers?

GNNFingers is a framework for protecting intellectual property (IP) in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by generating unique fingerprints of trained models. 
These fingerprints are then used to verify ownership of suspect models (possibly pirated) using a universal binary classifier.

This reproduction implements the full pipeline across multiple datasets and architectures, using PyTorch Geometric. The major steps include:

1. Victim GNN Training  
   Each victim model is trained on a standard dataset (e.g., Cora or ENZYMES).

2. Variant Generation  
   - Positive (Pirated): Fine-tuned, pruned, or distilled from the victim.
   - Negative (Irrelevant): Independently trained models with no knowledge of the victim.

3. Fingerprint Extraction 
   A pre-defined optimized fingerprint graph is passed through all models to extract 64-dimensional embeddings.

4. Universal Verifier Training  
   A binary MLP classifier (FingerprintNetMLP) is trained to distinguish pirated vs irrelevant fingerprints.

5. Evaluation  
   Using metrics: Accuracy, AUROC, ARUC, Robustness (TPR), and Uniqueness (TNR).


 Dataset Descriptions and Model Setup
 Node Classification
- Cora: Citation network of machine learning papers (7 classes, 2708 nodes, 1433 features).
- Citeseer: Scientific publications (6 classes, 3327 nodes, 3703 features).

Graph Classification
- NCI1 (Linux): Molecular graphs, binary classification (used in Figure 5 of the paper).
- ENZYMES: Protein classification (6 classes, 600 graphs).
- PROTEINS: Binary classification for protein structures.

Each dataset is used to train 4 architectures:
- GCNMean: GCN with global mean pooling
- GCNDiff: GCN with DiffPool or residual layers
- SAGEMean: GraphSAGE with mean aggregation
- SAGEDiff: GraphSAGE with diffpooling
